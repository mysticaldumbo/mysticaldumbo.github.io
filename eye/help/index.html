    <h1>how to use:</h1>
    <p>because eyebrowser is not yet created, you can't really use it. however, the search engine page is already being worked on and you can actually make it your main browser page.</p>
    <p>first, intsall an extension to use custom startup pages. for chrome or edge, i reccomend <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia">this.</a></p>
    <p>now, open a new tab and you can customize your new tab via the extension. for your custom url, input https://mysticaldumbo.github.io/eye/main-page. now any new tab you open should use the eyebrowser page.</p>
